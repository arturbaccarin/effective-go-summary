# The blank identifier

The blank identifier can be assigned or declared with any value of any type, with the value discarded harmlessly.

## The blank identifier in multiple assignment

The use of a blank identifier in a for range loop is a special case of a general situation: multiple assignment.

If an assignment requires multiple values on the left side, but one of the values will not be used by the program, a blank identifier on the left-hand-side of the assignment avoids the need to create a dummy variable and makes it clear that the value is to be discarded. For instance, when calling a function that returns a value and an error, but only the error is important, use the blank identifier to discard the irrelevant value.

```go
if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
    fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", path)
}
```

**_Occasionally you'll see code that discards the error value in order to ignore the error; this is terrible practice._**

**_Always check error returns_**; they're provided for a reason.

```go
// Bad! This code will crash if path does not exist.
fi, _ := os.Stat(path)
if fi.IsDir() {
    fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", path)
}
```

# Unused imports and variables

It is an error to import a package or to declare a variable without using it. Unused imports bloat the program and slow compilation, while a variable that is initialized but not used is at least a wasted computation and perhaps indicative of a larger bug. **_When a program is under active development, however, unused imports and variables often arise and it can be annoying to delete them just to have the compilation proceed, only to have them be needed again later. The blank identifier provides a workaround_**.

To silence complaints about the unused imports, use a blank identifier to refer to a symbol from the imported package.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

var _ = fmt.Printf // For debugging; delete when done.
var _ io.Reader    // For debugging; delete when done.

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open("test.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // TODO: use fd.
    _ = fd
}
```

## Import for side effect

Sometimes it is useful to import a package only for its side effects, without any explicit use. For example, during its init function, the net/http/pprof package registers HTTP handlers that provide debugging information. It has an exported API, but most clients need only the handler registration and access the data through a web page. To import the package only for its side effects, rename the package to the blank identifier:

```go
import _ "net/http/pprof"
```

This form of import makes clear that the package is being imported for its side effects, because there is no other possible use of the package: in this file, it doesn't have a name. (If it did, and we didn't use that name, the compiler would reject the program.)

## Interface checks

In practice, most interface conversions are static and therefore checked at compile time. For example, passing an *os.File to a function expecting an io.Reader will not compile unless *os.File implements the io.Reader interface.

**_Some interface checks do happen at run-time_**, though. One instance is in the encoding/json package, which defines a Marshaler interface. When the JSON encoder receives a value that implements that interface, the encoder invokes the value's marshaling method to convert it to JSON instead of doing the standard conversion. The encoder checks this property at run time with a type assertion like:

```go
m, ok := val.(json.Marshaler)
```

If it's necessary only to ask whether a type implements an interface, without actually using the interface itself, perhaps as part of an error check, use the blank identifier to ignore the type-asserted value:

```go
if _, ok := val.(json.Marshaler); ok {
    fmt.Printf("value %v of type %T implements json.Marshaler\n", val, val)
}
```

In Go, interfaces are satisfied implicitly, so the compiler doesn't automatically check if a type truly implements an interface unless it's used that way. To ensure a type like *RawMessage correctly implements an interface like json.Marshaler, developers use a compile-time check with a declaration like var _ json.Marshaler = (*RawMessage)(nil). This line assigns a *RawMessage (converted to json.Marshaler) to the blank identifier _, triggering a compiler check. If the type doesn't fully implement the interface, the code won't compileâ€”helping catch mistakes early and ensuring that custom behavior (like JSON encoding) works as intended.

```go
var _ json.Marshaler = (*RawMessage)(nil)
```

In this declaration, the assignment involving a conversion of a *RawMessage to a Marshaler requires that *RawMessage implements Marshaler, and that property **_will be checked at compile time_**. Should the json.Marshaler interface change, this package will no longer compile and we will be on notice that it needs to be updated.
